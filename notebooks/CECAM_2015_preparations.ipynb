    "Get the appropriate [miniconda installer](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html) for Python 2.7; in the example we are using the Linux 64 bit one. Common choices:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Linux x96_64 (64 bit): https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh\n",
    "- Mac OS X (64 bit): https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh\n",

    "- The installation is performed in the [virtual environment](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/) named **mdaenv**, which must be activated for use in the each shell session. (For more technical details see [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/).)\n",
    "- If you do not have the netCDF libraries installed, do not include the `netcdf4` package.\n",
    "- ` --no-cache-dir` may be necessary to avoid a `MemoryError` in low-memory environments such as our virtual machines; with lots of memory you may omit it (see [pip issue #2984](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/2984)).\n",
    "- conda will also install the HDF5 and netcdf libraries for you so you will have a *full feature* installation of MDAnalysis\n",
