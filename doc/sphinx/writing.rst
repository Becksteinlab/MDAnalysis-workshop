 Writing coordinates
=====================

MDAnalysis also supports writing of data in a range of file formats
(see the `Table of supported coordinate formats`_ for
details). MDAnalysis supports both *single frame* writers (such as a
simple PDB or GRO file) and *trajectory* writers (e.g. XTC, DCD, but
also multi-frame PDB files).

.. _`Table of supported coordinate formats`:
   https://pythonhosted.org/MDAnalysis/documentation_pages/coordinates/init.html#id1

.. _writing-single-frames:

Single frames
=============

The most straightforward way to write to a file that can only hold a
single frame is to use the
:meth:`~MDAnalysis.core.AtomGroup.AtomGroup.write` method of any
:class:`~MDAnalysis.core.AtomGroup.AtomGroup` as already also shown under
:ref:`processing-atomgroups`. For instance, to only write out the
protein without solvent to a file in GRO format::

   u = MDAnalysis.Universe(PDB)
   protein = u.selectAtoms("protein")
   protein.write("protein.gro")

MDAnalysis uses the file suffix to determine the output file format
(unless the *format* keyword is specified) and will raise an exception
if it is not suitable for single frame writing.


.. _writing-trajectories:

Trajectories
============

The typical use pattern is to

#. Get a trajectory writer with :func:`MDAnalysis.Writer` (which is
   the same as :func:`MDAnalysis.coordinates.core.writer`), typically
   specifying in advance how many atoms a frame will contain.
#. Use the :meth:`~MDAnalysis.coordinates.base.Writer.write` method to
   write a new time step to the trajectory.
#. Close the trajectory with
   :meth:`~MDAnalysis.coordinates.base.Writer.close` (although it is
   recommended to simply use the writer with the :keyword:`with`
   statement and have the context handler close the file automatically).

Example: Protein-only trajectory
--------------------------------

In practice, the second step is typically repeated in a loop as in the
example below::

  import MDAnalysis
  from MDAnalysis.tests.datafiles import PDB, XTC
  
  u = MDAnalysis.Universe(PDB, XTC)
  protein = u.selectAtoms("protein")
  with MDAnalysis.Writer("protein.xtc", protein.numberOfAtoms()) as W:
      for ts in u.trajectory:
          W.write(protein)

The loop steps through the input trajectory frame by frame. The
coordinates of the selection (the
:class:`~MDAnalysis.core.AtomGroup.AtomGroup` ``protein``) change
accordingly and are then written as a new frame into the output
trajectory.

The output trajectory only contains the coordinates of the
protein. For this trajectory to be useful, a protein-only topology
file also has to be stored, as in the example under
:ref:`writing-single-frames`.


Example: Saving dynamic per-atom properties in B-factor
-------------------------------------------------------

It is often very useful to project per-atom properties on the
structure. A common approach is to save scalar values in the B-factor
field of a PDB file and then color atoms by B-factor (also known as
"beta" or temperature factor).

The following example computes the shift of each atom in AdK relative to a
reference structure (after a structural superposition on the CORE
domain) and projects it on the B-factor with the
:meth:`MDAnalysis.core.AtomGroup.AtomGroup.set_bfactor` method. Each
frame is written out as part of a multi-frame PDB file:

To visualize in VMD_, use the script ``pdbbfactor.tcl`` below on the
VMD Tcl commandline:

.. code-block:: tcl

  source pdbbfactor.tcl
  pdbbfactor adk_distance_bfac.pdb

`pdbbfactor`_ was originally written by Justin Gullingsrud (2004) and
slightly modified for this tutorial:

.. Note:: We could have also directly loaded the scalar data into the
          ``User`` field in VMD_; this is demonstrated in
          `vmduser.py`_.
