 How to use this tutorial
==========================

If you have not installed MDAnalysis_ yet, start with
:ref:`chapter-installing-mdanalysis`.

If you already have a working installation, i.e., you can successfully
do ::

  import MDAnalysis
  from MDAnalysis.tests.datafiles import PSF, DCD

then you can immediately read about the initial
:ref:`chapter-preparations`.

After that, the tutorial is designed to be read and worked through by
yourself at your own pace. It contains short examples that introduce
important features and ideas. You should run all these examples and
code snippets yourself. *Exercises* (with solutions) are included. You
can

* follow the tutorial online in your browser, starting with the
  chapter :ref:`chapter-basics`, or
* use the Jupyter ipython notebook `MDAnalysisTutorial.ipynb`_ (which
  contains all the code and exercises but fewer hyperlinks and images
  and less explanatory text). `Download the notebook`_ and open it
  with :program:`ipython`::

     ipython notebook MDAnalysisTutorial.ipynb
