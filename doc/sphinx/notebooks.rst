============================
 Tutorial Jupyter Notebooks
============================

`@orbeckst`_ gave an introductory presentation (available in PDF_ or
Keynote08_ format) on MDAnalysis, its philopsophy and overall
structure and development process.

The workshop session was held by `@dotsdl`_ and `@orbeckst`_. They
live-coded in Jupyter_ notebooks.

Fundamentals
============

The notebook `MDAnalysis_Workshop_Part_1.ipynb`_ introduces the
fundamental objects of MDAnalysis: the ``Universe``, ``AtomGroup``,
and ``Atom`` objects. It also introduces the *selection language*, and
the basics of *reading* and *slicing trajectories*.


Trajectory analysis
===================

The notebook `MDAnalysis_Workshop_Part_2.ipynb`_ teaches how to work
with trajectories. The lesson includes different ways to access and select
frames and introduces common programming patterns from frame-based
analysis, including a range of real-world examples using the
trajectories from the :ref:`chapter-datadownload` section.
