 MDAnalysis Tutorial at the 2015 CECAM Macromolecular Simulation Software Workshop
===================================================================================

MDAnalysis_ is an open source Python library that helps you to quickly
write your own analysis algorithm for studying trajectories produced
by the most popular simulation packages [Michaud-Agrawal2011]_.


The `CECAM Macromolecular simulation software workshop`_ contains a
two-day `mini-workshop on analysing simulation data`_ lead by Dr
Phillip Fowler (Oct 14/15, 2015). As part of the workshop, a team of
MDAnalysis_ developers (`Oliver Beckstein`_, `David Dotson`_, `Tyler
Reddy`_, `Phil Fowler`_) will be at hand to give an *introduction to
MDAnalysis* on the first day and be available to help with projects
during the *hackathon* on the second day.

In order to prepare for the tutorial session on Wednesday Oct 14, 2015
you should

1. :ref:`install MDAnalysis<chapter-installing-mdanalysis>` (and
   its dependencies) on your laptop (Linux or Mac OS X)
2. :ref:`download example data<chapter-datadownload>`

.. Note:: 

   Please complete these two tasks well in advance of the workshop
   because there will be very little time to do this during the
   tutorial session. The example data real-world trajectories are
   about 300 MiB and downloading over a WiFi connection with 25 other
   people attempting to do the same will almost certainly fail.
